My standard *NIX config
-----------------------

Some of it is nice, but most of it is boring.

In early 2019 I started a fresh repo, part of this was because I wanted
have faster clone times, but most of it was because I was embarrassed of
the mistakes of my past, stupid workarounds, and wot not.

In 2020 I merged my previous years history into one repo, this is that
repo. Hopefully nothing has been lost from the start. (2014) Sadly the
two repos that were always separate, but related, are not easy to
merge. Said repos contained my original emacs config, and my separate
Macbook Pro 11,1 config (laptop I since sold)

convert music to opus:

  for i in *.mp3; do \
   ffmpeg -i "$i" -acodec libopus -b:a 256000 -vbr off "${i%.*}.opus"; \
  done

cut out section:

  ffmpeg -i in.opus -ss 00:00:20 -to 00:00:40 -c copy out.opus

in the procps-ng version of 'top', for [subjectively] easier
