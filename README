My standard \*NIX config
========================

Some of it is nice, but most of it is boring.

In early 2019 I started a fresh repo, part of this was because I wanted have
faster clone times, but most of it was because I was embarrassed of the
mistakes of my past, stupid workarounds, and wot not.

In 2020 I merged my previous years history into one repo, this is that
repo. Hopefully nothing has been lost from the start. (2014) Sadly the two
repos that were always separate, but related, are not easy to merge. Said repos
contained my original emacs config, and my separate Macbook Pro 11,1 config
(laptop I since sold)

ffmpeg
------

convert music to opus::

  for i in *.mp3; do ffmpeg -i "$i" -acodec libopus -b:a 256000 -vbr off "${i%.*}.opus"; done

cut out section::

  ffmpeg -i in.opus -ss 00:00:20 -to 00:00:40 -c copy out.opus

FIXME:
------

* find a solution for RSS/atom feeds that uses stock GNU Emacs. elfeed is the
  best I can find so far, but doesn't ship with GNU Emacs. Gnus is slooooow,
  and breaks if a feed is down for a day.

* use SASL for IRC.


Unicode for testing:
