# this is potentionally a bad idea. i do it for proper colours in
# emacs, however it will mess up custom themes in emacs if you use
# them (i don't). one could use an alias for emacs instead, but i've
# had problems with completion in the past as a result.
#
# this is bad because a program will get told it is inside screen,
# which is not ture unless you are inside screen, and could changes
# it's behaviour based on that. (thanks twb on freenode for
# explaining.)
